# PERSONAL PORTFOLIO
Built with <3 using React and Sass (works well with CSS, but I wanted to have a taste of Sass, as it has nesting ability). For animations, I used a combination of self-made, AOS library and React-Transition Group.

## to work on this project: 
```terminal
$git clone https://github.com/dyannd/portfolio.git
$npm install 
```
Deployed build on Netlify. View my portfolio on www.dyannd.com !
## feel free to use my Portfolio as a template, must be sure to give me credit!
